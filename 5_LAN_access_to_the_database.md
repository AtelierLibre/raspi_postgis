# 5. LAN access to the database

For the purposes of this project, the PostGIS database lives on the Raspberry Pi but any visualising of the data is done on another local computer.

To make that happen access to the database from other local computers has to be enabled by editing two files:

- `postgresql.conf`
- `pg_hba.conf`

## `postgresql.conf`

## `pg_hba.conf`
